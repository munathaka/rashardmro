# Job Details
New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

As part of the IT Special Programs team, the candidate will provide daily operational and expert support for highly available COTS and custom applications, systems, and platforms to solve a wide array of customer needs and requests and enable projects to perform and deliver on milestones and deadlines to non-NASA sponsors. The Computer Systems Engineer is responsible for effective installation/configuration, operation, and maintenance of software and systems along with related support infrastructure. This individual also participates in technical research and development to enable continuing innovation within the infrastructure. This individual ensures that software systems and related procedures adhere to organizational values and sponsor and cybersecurity requirements. Candidates must be self-starters and be able to solve complex problems with minimal supervision.

- Deploy and maintain various authentication methods utilizing LDAP, Active Directory, Kerberos, and RSA multifactor authentication

- Develop middleware tools in Python, BASH, PowerShell to unify multiple disparate systems and simplify the process of account deployment. Other programming languages are a plus.

- Maintain storage and virtualization infrastructure on NetApp, VMware, and VergeIO

- Maintain container environments using Docker and Podman

- Streamline OS upgrades in RedHat Enterprise Linux utilizing [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/save-date-ansiblefest-2018) for virtual and bare-metal workstations

# Wartime Sexual Violence [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence) [Genocidal rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidal_rape) [War rape - psychology.fandom](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/War_rape)
 <img src="https://16days.thepixelproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/War-rape.jpg" style="width:400px;height:600px;margin-left:15px;" align="right" alt="Pineapple" /> 
<p>Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military occupation often as spoils of war, but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. A war crime, it is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]</p>
<p>During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific battles or massacres, as well as individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Rape can also be recognized as genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. International legal instruments for prosecuting perpetrators for genocide were developed in the 1990s, with the Akayesu case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda being widely considered as a precedent.[4] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.</p>
<p>## Definition of wartime sexual violence # Main article: Rape There is no consensus definition of wartime sexual violence, as there is variance in what forms of violence are included in the definition and variance in which violence is considered conflict-related.[5] The terms rape, sexual assault and sexual violence are frequently used interchangeably.[6] The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the International Criminal Court, defines rape as follows: </p><p> The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.[7] and The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of giving genuine consent.[7] </p><p>The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[8] A prominent data-set on conflict-related sexual violence, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC), builds on the ICC definition and covers seven forms of violence: "(a) rape, (b) sexual slavery, (c) forced prostitution, (d) forced pregnancy, (e) forced sterilization/abortion, (f) sexual mutilation, and (g) sexual torture."[5] The data-set defines conflict-related sexual violence as the sexual violence committed "armed actors (specifically, state militaries, rebel groups, and progovernment militias) during periods of conflict or immediately postconflict," thus excluding sexual violence by civilians.[5] More expansive definitions may define wartime sexual violence as being committed even by civilians if the conflict creates a sense of impunity.[5]</p>

Hi Im still learning how to structure letters! I am Rashard Kelly as my documentation i was given at what i was called my age of responsibility in Savannah Georgia. I married a girl in Alameda named Erika Johnson. We made the connection online on a site called [JWmatch.com](https://www.jwmatch.com/s/a/13906/us_s?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJUVKuEcZDx6T8rSSxErIqFZ48o8DAe9ve0zpmxxsOoUJX0Z3i1B6thoCRukQAvD_BwE). A man named Marvin Radovitch was a Jehovahs Witness and got [disfellowshipped](https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/disfellowship-shunning.php) in [Savannah Georgia](https://savannahga.gov/). He was bored and started making friends on [AOL](https://www.wired.com/1999/10/aoldata/) and wanted me to have friends. I was good with girls, but there is a [mob that playboy runss](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-las-vegas-playboy-bloods-street-gang-sentenced-23-years-prison) that captured all my girlfriends and like we paired but there was all this legal much in Jehovahs witnesses about Sexual Contact so my handler Willie Kelly Jr would not let me go off the street. And my Ibeji twin was abducted and raped according to the story she gave me.

Her mom started a sexual relationship at some point in the tiemline that I did not know about! We were driving a red mustang. I remember some guys in a Blue Grand MArquis rolled up on us in Van Nuys. Erika said i should quit working for a while and Grow. This was after a woman i thought was my mother died! Erika was never nice to me. She is family and I would never hurt her. She ran away when I hit her back. She was abusive bc after [Jehovahs Witnesses fell apart she felt stuck. ](https://x.com/Essence/status/1248047995804884992). I have no problem with her relationship status, but it left me crippled fiscally and immobile, i was 3 weeks late on my car payment and her boyfriend stole my honda fit. I had to let the mustang go for a Title loan bc the car was getting poisoned and i could not afford to commute in it. At least i would have the warranty with the new car. I had no carpayment b4. I get fired as soon as i get comfortable. Since i have a past with NAsa its hard to get work bc im not into porn. But I was advised that I was [Mars Mission Staff](https://github.com/nasa)!
